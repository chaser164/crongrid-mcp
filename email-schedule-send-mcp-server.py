    Never make a scheduled email cron job repeating (the final argument of the function) unless the user explicitly asks for it; assume the user wants a one-time email unless they explicitly ask for a repeating email send.
    If the user does not provide a to_email parameter, the email will be sent to the FROM_EMAIL environment variable (email to self). 
    So, do not provide a to_email parameter when the user requests an email to self (e.g. "send an email to myself," "remind me to do something," "create a reminder," "send me an email," etc.). 
    Expiration is automatically set for one-time emails. For repeating emails, expiration is up to the user; it is defaulted to 0, which means the email will be sent indefinitely. Assume the user does not want the repeated send to expire unless they explicitly ask for it.
    Repeated emails have a [-1] as one of the time parameters, which means the email will be sent every minute, hour, day, month, or week. Non-repeated emails only have non-negative time parameters.
    If the user asks for an email at a relative time, you can use the get_current_datetime tool to get the current time in the user's timezone and then use that to schedule the email. ALWAYS use the default timezone value unless the user explicitly asks for a different timezone.

        months: Months to run (1-12, or [-1] for every month). 
        wdays: Days of week to run (0-6 where 0=Sunday, or [-1] for every day).
        expires_at: Date/time (in jobâ€™s time zone) after which the job expires, i.e. after which it is not scheduled anymore (format: YYYYMMDDhhmmss, 0 = does not expire)
        to_email: Recipient email address. Default is None, which means the email will be sent to the FROM_EMAIL environment variable (email to self).
